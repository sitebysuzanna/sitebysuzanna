	<h2>Hobbies</h2>
	<p>Some of my hobbies that I enjoy doing are reading and taking pictures with my camera. Both of those hobbies of mine always calm me down when I am stressed out. My favorite hobby is taking pictures, it is very calming and very fun. I mostly take pictures of the sky and buildings. I am not a professional so I just stick to taking pictures of simple things! Here are a few picutes I took.</p>

	<h2>Interests</h2>
	<p>I am very interested in technology and learning new things about it. I also like to be outside and do activites such as play soccer and basketball with my two older sisters. </p>
		
	<h2>Family</h2>
	<p>In my family I have two older sisters who are both over 20. They both work at Memorial Care but in different locations. My mom also works at Memorial Care with one of my sisters. My mom works in two different hospitals Memorial Care and TCC she is amazing! My dad works with granite he basically cuts granite for countertops and other things. It sounds boring but it is kinda dangerous working with big power tools. So that is my hard working family, with all amazing jobs. </p>

	<h2>Skills</h2>
	
<p>Some skills that I have are creating videos and editing them in imovie. Creating houses and museums in Sketchup. Photoshopping old people making them look younger in Photoshop which was really fun! Taking photos at the right angles and using the rule of thirds to make more pleasing to the eye.</p>
